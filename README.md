- The full transcription of each letter.
- Annotations to provide context for historical figures, places, and key concepts mentioned in the correspondence.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the XML files** to read through the encoded letters.
2. **Download and parse** the XML data for further research or integration with digital humanities projects.
<!-- 3. Use the **schema** in the `/schema/` folder to validate the structure of the XML files or extend the encoding framework for your own research. -->
