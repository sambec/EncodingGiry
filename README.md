# üìú Arthur Giry's Correspondence: Letters from Colleagues and Students Across Europe

Welcome to this repository, which aims to preserve and showcase the scholarly correspondence received by **Arthur Giry** from his colleagues and former students across Europe. This project focuses on the letters sent to Giry as part of his research for his monumental work, **"Manuel de diplomatique"** published in 1894.

## üìù Project Overview

Arthur Giry, a renowned French historian and paleographer, played a key role in the development of **diplomatics**, the critical study of historical documents. His book, *Manuel de diplomatique*, remains an essential reference in the field. Throughout the years leading up to its publication, Giry corresponded with many scholars, researchers, and former students who provided critical insights and resources to aid in his research.

This repository contains XML-encoded transcriptions of letters Giry received, highlighting the intellectual exchanges that contributed to the **formation of his ideas** and **methodological advancements** in diplomatics.

## üí° Objectives of this Project

The purpose of this project is to:
1. **Preserve historical correspondence**: By digitizing and encoding these letters, we aim to make this valuable scholarly exchange accessible to a wider audience.
2. **Highlight Giry's research network**: Show how Arthur Giry‚Äôs collaborations across Europe influenced his work on diplomatics.
3. **Facilitate analysis**: Using XML to structure the content enables thematic and contextual analysis, which can support deeper research into Giry's contributions to history and diplomatics.
4. **Provide open access**: All XML files are published under an open license to encourage further research and academic use.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`/letters/`**: This folder contains the XML-encoded letters received by Arthur Giry.
  - Each file represents a single letter encoded in XML following TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) guidelines.
  - Example: `letter_1886_09_23.xml` would represent a letter sent to Giry on September 23, 1886.
  
- **`/schema/`**: This folder contains the DTD and schema definitions used for encoding the XML files.
  - Example: `giry_correspondence.dtd`

- **`/resources/`**: Supporting materials, such as the digitized scans of the letters, bibliography, and further readings about Giry's work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Encoding Standards

All letters in this repository are encoded in **XML** using the **TEI guidelines** to ensure accurate representation of the structure and content of the original documents. The encoding includes:
- Metadata about the sender, recipient, date, and location.
- The full transcription of each letter.
- Annotations to provide context for historical figures, places, and key concepts mentioned in the correspondence.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the XML files** in the `/letters/` folder to read through the encoded letters.
2. **Download and parse** the XML data for further research or integration with digital humanities projects.
3. Use the **schema** in the `/schema/` folder to validate the structure of the XML files or extend the encoding framework for your own research.

## üèõÔ∏è Historical Significance

These letters not only shed light on the creation of Giry's *Manuel de diplomatique* but also offer insights into the broader academic network in **19th-century Europe**. The letters demonstrate how scholars across borders collaborated to shape the understanding of medieval documentation and diplomatic practices.
